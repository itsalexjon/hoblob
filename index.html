<h3><strong>Keep your pup leashed or in a cart at all times</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Make sure you take a potty break</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don't leave your dog (or yourself) in a craft store without taking a potty break. Avoid lifting legs or leaving logs inside.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Treats and toys should be packed</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can keep Fren calm in a place with a lot of scents and sounds by having treats on hand to distract him from commotion.
